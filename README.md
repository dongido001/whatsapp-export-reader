If you have ever wanted to read an exported WhatsApp chat messages, then this app is for you.

The live URL of the project can be found [here](https://whapp-reader.herokuapp.com/). You just need to upload your `.txt` file and read your message.

# Why

I was added to a WhatsApp group but I came in late, the conversation was already going on for some days. Now you know in WhatsApp, you can't read messages that were added before you joined the group. I wanted to catch up with the discussion, so I asked the Admin to help me export the messages so I can read the previous conversation. I made a simple UI where I can upload the exported file and read it comfortably. And here it is!
